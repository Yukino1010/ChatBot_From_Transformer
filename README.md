# ChatBot_From_Transformer

## Introduction and Results

This time I am going to use Transformer that I mentioned in my last repository to build a Chinese chatbot. <br>

The model structure will be same as my last impliment, but this time I'm going to use BertTokenizer to encode the sentence to token and 
add some randomness to the model's output to make sure that the same input can have some different results.
